# Supoort-Vector-Machine-SVM
This repository contains an implementation of Support Vector Machine (SVM), a powerful supervised learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. SVM works by finding the optimal hyperplane that separates data points into different classes with the maximum margin.
